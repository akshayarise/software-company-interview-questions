Named Exports vs Default Exports:
A few characteristics of named exports are the following:

When you use named exports, you can export multiple values, functions, or classes from a single file, giving each of them a specific name.
You need to wrap the items you want to export in curly braces {} when importing them in another file, and you must use the exact names used during the export.
Named exports are great when you want to share multiple things from a file and give them distinct names to use in other parts of your code.
A file can have as many named exports as you like.
A few characteristics of default exports are the following:

Default exports are useful when you want to export only one main thing from a file. It is like marking that one thing as the most important to share.
When importing a default export in another file, you can give it any name you want during the import, and you don't need to use curly braces {}.
A file can have only one default export.
